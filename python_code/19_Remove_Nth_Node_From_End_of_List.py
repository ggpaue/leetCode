#Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

#Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?



#Example 1:


#Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
#Output: [1,2,3,5]
#Example 2:

#Input: head = [1], n = 1
#Output: []
#Example 3:

#Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
#Output: [1]


#Constraints:

#The number of nodes in the list is sz.
#1 <= sz <= 30
#0 <= Node.val <= 100
#1 <= n <= sz

# Definition for singly-linked list.
